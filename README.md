# Run Mail2Most as a service

You can run Mail2Most using docker, docker-compose or as a systemd service.

## docker

[docker-hub link](https://hub.docker.com/r/virtomize/mail2most)

Using docker you need to change the path to your mail2most.conf

```
docker run \
  -v /path/to/mail2most.conf:/mail2most/conf/mail2most.conf \
  virtomize/mail2most:latest
```

e.g. if you are in this repo:

```
docker run \
  -v $(pwd)/conf/mail2most.conf:/mail2most/conf/mail2most.conf \
  virtomize/mail2most:latest
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `latest` tag image is rebuild on a daily base to get newest OS package updates inside the docker image.

## docker-compose

[docker-hub link](https://hub.docker.com/r/virtomize/mail2most)

Using docker-compose you can just edit the `conf/mail2most.conf` or change the path inside the docker-compose.yml to your config:

```
    volumes:
      - ./conf/mail2most.conf:/mail2most/conf/mail2most.conf
```

```
    volumes:
      - /path/to/my/mail2most.conf:/mail2most/conf/mail2most.conf
```

then just start a container user

```
docker-compose up -d
```

## Systemd

Systemd allows you to create a background service to run mail2most managed by your system:

- create `/opt/mail2most` and place the mail2most binary into it
  - `mkdir -p /opt/mail2most/conf`
- create `/opt/mail2most/conf/mail2most.conf`
- place the following file to `/etc/systemd/system/mail2most.service`

```
# mail2most

## Common problems

**Problem: mail2most crashes after profile changes**

Solution: This happens when the data.json is not consistent to the config changes. Delete data.json to solve this problem.

**Problem: Channel contains special characters mattermost can not found the channel**

Solution: Mattermost does not support special characters for channel names, only in display names. To find the correct channel name use the last part of the url found under `view info`
